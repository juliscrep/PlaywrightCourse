In this course, the following topics were covered:

* End-to-End Testing: Automated testing of web applications using Playwright and TypeScript to ensure functionality throughout the entire user journey.
* Page Object Model (POM): Implementation of the POM pattern to improve scalability, maintainability, and organization of test scripts.
* API Testing: Advanced techniques for validating the functionality and performance of APIs, including endpoint testing, data handling, and ensuring expected behavior.
* Report Generation: Creation of detailed and visually appealing reports to provide clear insights into test results.
* Mocking in Playwright: Generating and using mocks to simulate real-world scenarios and ensure a robust testing environment.
* Soft Assertions: Using soft assertions in Playwright to verify multiple conditions without immediately failing a test.
* Annotations: Utilization of annotations such as skip, only, tags, fixme, and fail to control and manage test execution.
